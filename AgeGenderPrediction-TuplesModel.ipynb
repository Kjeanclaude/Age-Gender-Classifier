    "[INTRODUCTION](#Introduction)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to create an **Age-Gender Predictor**. It was inspired by the [Age and Gender Classification Dataset of the Open University of Israel (Face Image Project)](http://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/projects/cnn_agegender/CNN_AgeGenderEstimation.pdf).\n",
    "The intended goal of the project is to generate age gender on unseen face images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Age and gender classification using convolutional neural networks\" is a research paper related to the dataset above providing separately age or gender labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main challenges are:\n",
    "- **1- Find an age and gender labeled dataset to train our implementations :** Find dozen of face images from the internet with their correct age and gender is easy. But when you talk about several thousands of images, ***the task is very hard and expensive***. So, during our research we coincidently found the free ***Age and Gender Classification Dataset of the Open University of Israel (Face Image Project)*** which as 8 classes of age instead of 6 as in the original paper. ***A lot of thanks to them.***\n",
    "- **2- Transform the dataset to reach our goals :** The Age and Gender Classification Dataset has some very good implementations in Tensorflow for Data preparation and tests. But they have a different goal, their implementation only performs seperate prediction of genders and ages. The goal here is to produce both prediction on each face image and try to outperform the accuracy. So, we should rewrite our own functions to reach our goals, using their annotations for the provided dataset. We need to match separate age and gender with their corresponding image ID and implement the prediction model.\n",
    "- **3- Try our implementation on video and mobile app (Optional) :** It is not too hard to label pictures in video when we don't have to simultaneously deal with the audio too. But we could have some surprises sometime because of frameworks dependencies. Moreover, at this time (April 2017) we don't have enough ressources about the transformation process of Deep learning Frameworks projects into mobile apps. Run a Deep learning code in a notebook implementation and run it as mobile app are very different. Each framework has its constraints, no universal methods for this (crossplatform iOS-Android-Windows Mobile, several frameworks, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "The main steps of implementation are:\n",
    "- **1- Data preparation :** create a dictionary of age and gender including all training set images\n",
    "- **2- One-hot labels :** create a dictionary of age and gender including all training set images\n",
    "- **3- Age and Gender Prediction :** create an ANN and train it with the prepared data to predict age and gender.\n",
    "- **4- Mobile app implementation :** \n",

    "### Improvement\n",
    "We will try to increase the quality of images as we can (It is the challenge the original paper tried to overcome).\n",
    "We should try to provide result closer to below (even if we could not have the same accuracy because of amount of data and class of ages available with platform such as Microsoft, Facebook, etc.).\n",
    "- For the age and gender prediction on unseen images : https://how-old.net/ (Microsoft). It is very accurate.    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Framework limitation\n",
    "Tools we used to train and evaluate the dataset could have an influence on the result. For example, the use of a DNNClassifier or a Keras on Tensorflow has different requirements. The dataset structure should be a dictionary for one, and a list for another. So it would be interesting to evaluate all the possibilities and compare how accurate improvement there is for each use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future work\n",
    "\n",
    "- it would be worth to apply the same technic on other types of ANN such as GAN, as it is a recent field always in exploration, ***mainly the Wasserstein GAN*** which produces accurate results.\n",
    "- propose an ***universal and easy method*** for deployment of notebook implementations on a Mobile App"

Even if they have different objectives, the provided dataset have been very helpful to perform this work. While they used CNN on separate prediction of gender and age, we used FCNs for a pixel-wise precision for both age and gender prediction on the same image, in a unique process.\n",
